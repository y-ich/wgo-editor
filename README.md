# WGo Editor
This is an SGF editor using [WGo.js](http://wgo.waltheri.net/).

You can copy a current position into system clipboard as png by copy shortcut key.
It may be useful when tweeting a position.

Also, it has a functionality that shows main principal variations of positions by [Leela](https://www.sjeng.org/leela.html) or [Leela Zero](https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero) in real-time.
